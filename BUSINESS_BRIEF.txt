                    BUSINESS BRIEF - DYNAMIC QR CODE PLATFORM
================================================================================

WHAT IS OUR WEBSITE?
--------------------
Our platform is a Dynamic QR Code Generator that allows businesses to create
a single QR code that links to a customizable landing page with multiple
action buttons/icons.

CORE CONCEPT:

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

- Landing page shows all links as icons
- Each icon links to respective URL (Instagram, Facebook, etc.)

LANDING PAGE FEATURES:

================================================================================
PAYMENT QR CODE - IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION
================================================================================

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
----------------------
We have a "Pay Now" button on the landing page that:
- Opens UPI payment app directly
- Uses client's UPI ID
- Works like shop QR codes (direct payment)

QUESTION: Should we need two QR codes?
---------------------------------------
ANSWER: NO - We only need ONE QR code

EXPLANATION:
------------

OPTION 1: Single QR Code (Current Approach) - RECOMMENDED
----------------------------------------------------------
- ONE QR code points to landing page
- Landing page has "Pay Now" button
- Button opens UPI payment directly
- Works for all purposes (links + payment)

ADVANTAGES:
- Single QR code to print/manage
- Clean and simple
- All features in one place
- Easy for customers (scan once, access everything)

DISADVANTAGES:
- Requires one extra click (button click) for payment
- Not as direct as scanning payment QR code

OPTION 2: Two QR Codes (Alternative)
-------------------------------------
- QR Code 1: Landing page with links
- QR Code 2: Bank's payment QR code (for direct payment)

ADVANTAGES:
- Direct payment (no button click)
- Bank's QR code already works (no configuration needed)

DISADVANTAGES:
- Two QR codes to print/manage
- More confusing for customers
- Defeats the purpose of "one QR code for everything"
- More expensive (printing two codes)

OPTION 3: Use Bank's QR Code for Everything (Not Feasible)
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Bank's QR code only contains payment information
- Cannot add other links
- Would need separate QR codes for each link
- Defeats entire purpose of our platform

RECOMMENDATION:
--------------
Use OPTION 1: Single QR Code with "Pay Now" Button

REASONING:
- Maintains our core value proposition: "One QR code for everything"
- Simple for clients (one QR code to print)
- Simple for customers (scan once, access everything)
- Payment works (one extra click is acceptable)
- Professional and clean

CAN WE USE BANK'S QR CODE?
---------------------------
Yes, but only for payment, not for other links.

HOW IT WOULD WORK:
- Client gets payment QR code from bank
- Client uploads it as an image/link
- We display it on landing page
- Customer scans it for payment

PROBLEMS WITH THIS APPROACH:
- Bank's QR code is static (contains only payment info)
- Cannot add other links to it
- Would still need our QR code for other links
- Results in two QR codes (defeats our purpose)

BETTER APPROACH:
- Use our single QR code
- "Pay Now" button opens UPI payment directly
- Works like bank's QR code (direct payment)
- But also includes all other links
- Best of both worlds
